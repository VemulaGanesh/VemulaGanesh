The purpose is to design an AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the condition to their body part.

Below are features:
1. P_incidence 2. P_tilt 3. L_angle 4. S_slope 5. P_radius 6. S_degree 7. Class

Tasks performed:

1. Importing and cleaning the data
2. Data analysis and visualisation
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model training, testing and tuning
5. Conclusion
