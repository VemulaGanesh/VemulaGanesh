    "**Domain: Semiconductor manufacturing process**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex modern semiconductor manufacturing process is normally under constant surveillance via the monitoring of signals/\n",
    "variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These signals can be used as features to predict the yield type. And by analysing and trying out different combinations of features, essential signals that are impacting the yield type can be identified\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to build a classifier to predict the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity and analyse whether all the \n",
    "features are required to build the model or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing and cleaning the data\n",
    "2. EDA and visualisation\n",
    "3. Data preprocessing\n",
    "4. Model training, testing and tuning (Using all kinds of ML models and hyper paramter tuning)\n",
